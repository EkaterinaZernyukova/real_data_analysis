Certain Austin Energy budget items have been excluded as competitive matters under Texas Government Code Section 552.133 and City Council Resolution 20051201-002; The comparison of actual expenditures to budget may appear inconsistent. That is because base wages for personnel are fully budgeted in the expense categories regular wages—full-time, regular wages—part-time or regular wages—civil service. The budget does not assume expenditure levels for the various leave categories, such as sick pay, vacation pay, or jury leave. However, actual expenses for various leave categories are recorded based on timesheet coding. The result is that actual expenditures for regular wages are spread across multiple expense categories while the budget is shown in one expense category; Personnel savings is budgeted to account for the likely savings in personnel costs generated through attrition. However, the savings is realized in the expense categories regular wages—full-time, regular wages—part-time and regular wages—civil service.

The ideal design of an Urban Trail is an off-street, 12 foot wide concrete path that can accommodate a variety of trail users including bicyclists, pedestrians, wheel chair users, parents with strollers, kids on razor scooters and so on. Since the first Urban Trails Master Plan was adopted in September 2014 not all existing trail segments in this dataset strictly comply with the guidelines described in Appendix A: Trail Design Criteria of the Urban Trails Master Plan. The Urban Trails network is intended to be a part of the greater Active Transportation Network and may relate to the on-street bicycle network or the sidewalk network, as well as City of Austin parks. In this dataset, many Urban Trail endpoints connect to the City of Austin’s streets dataset or the City of Austin’s parks dataset.; The data in this feature class was created by the amalgamation of three datasets:  the Parks and Recreation Trail Layer (based on their Long Range Facilities Master Plan), the Neighborhood Planning Implementation Layer, and feedback and comments received during the Urban Trail Master Plan process (October 2012-September 2014) For more information, the Urban Trails Master Plan can be found here: http://www.mediafire.com/view/qusnf4qg3h4v4z7/UTMP_online.pdf","08/18/2015 07:10:30 PM +0000","378","Urban Trails","","Steven Linett","Government","map","As Needed","Public Works","false"

See http://www.austintexas.gov/department/planning for more information. The Growth Concept Map assembles compact and walkable activity centers and corridors, as well as job centers, and coordinates them with future transportation improvements. These centers and corridors allow people to reside, work, shop, access services, people watch, recreate, and hang out without traveling far distances. Within them, the design and scale of buildings and the design and availability of parks and gathering spaces will welcome people of all ages and abilities. They will be walkable, bikable, and connected to one another, the rest of the city, and the region by roads, transit, bicycle routes and lanes, and trails. The activity centers and corridors included on this map identify locations for additional people and jobs above what currently exists on the ground. Unlike more detailed small-area plan maps, the Growth Concept Map provides broad direction for future growth and is not parcel specific. Centers that are already established by existing small-area plans, such as those for East Riverside Drive or Highland Mall, are drawn to reflect those plans. Centers without small-area plans are simply shown with a circle, indicating scale and general location. Specifying boundaries for these centers may occur through small-area plans or general guidelines for implementing this plan. This product is for informational purposes and may not have been prepared for or be suitable for legal, engineering, or surveying purposes.

See http://www.austintexas.gov/department/planning for more information. The Growth Concept Map assembles compact and walkable activity centers and corridors, as well as job centers, and coordinates them with future transportation improvements. These centers and corridors allow people to reside, work, shop, access services, people watch, recreate, and hang out without traveling far distances. Within them, the design and scale of buildings and the design and availability of parks and gathering spaces will welcome people of all ages and abilities. They will be walkable, bikable, and connected to one another, the rest of the city, and the region by roads, transit, bicycle routes and lanes, and trails. The activity centers and corridors included on this map identify locations for additional people and jobs above what currently exists on the ground. Unlike more detailed small-area plan maps, the Growth Concept Map provides broad direction for future growth and is not parcel specific. Centers that are already established by existing small-area plans, such as those for East Riverside Drive or Highland Mall, are drawn to reflect those plans. Centers without small-area plans are simply shown with a circle, indicating scale and general location.

An RCAP or ECAP is a neighborhood with significant concentrations of extreme poverty and minority populations; HUD’s definition of an RCAP/ECAP is:•	A Census tract that has a non‐white population of 50 percent or more AND a poverty rate of 40 percent or more; OR; •	A Census tract that has a non‐white population of 50 percent or more AND the poverty rate is three times the average tract poverty rate for the metro/micro area, whichever is lower; Why the 40 percent threshold? The RCAP/ECAP definition is not meant to suggest that a slightly‐lower‐than‐40 percent poverty rate is ideal or acceptable. The threshold was borne out of research that concluded a 40 percent poverty rate was the point at which a neighborhood became significantly socially and economically challenged. Conversely, research has shown that areas with up to 14 percent of poverty have no noticeable effect on community opportunity. (See Section II in City of Austin’s 2015 Analysis of Impediments to Fair Housing Choice: http://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/NHCD/Reports_Publications/1Analysis_Impediments_for_web.pdf) This dataset provides socioeconomic data on protected classes from the 2008-2012 American Community Survey on census tracts in Austin’s city limits and designates which of those tracts are considered RCAPs or ECAPs based on these socioeconomic characteristics.

Examples include the Imagine Austin Growth Concept map, City Council-approved infrastructure master plans (i.e. the City of Austin Sidewalk Master Plan), City Council-approved Neighborhood Plans, and City Council and/or departmental accepted reports (i.e. the Hispanic-Latino Quality of Life Initiative final report). These initiatives contain recommendations for areas to invest in or focus on certain capital improvements, the geographical boundaries of which are represented in the data set. The areas with the greatest number of overlapping initiatives are indicated by the darker shades, representing areas where capital investment can have a multiplier effect in implementing several city initiatives; The data is organized around Imagine Austin Priority Program topic areas: Compact and Connected, Nature and City, Creativity and Economy, Healthy and Affordable. The purpose of the LRCSP Strategic Investment Areas Overlay Analysis is to support the identification of: (a) Strategic investment in infrastructure that implements Imagine Austin, (b) Potential cost savings and other efficiencies and (c) Improved outcomes for our capital investments.

Generally, changes to the fuel rate are effective on Jan. 1 for the calendar year. Effective FY 2013, the power supply adjustment is set as part of the annual budget process. Fuel Charge rates are established based on the type of electric service required by a customer and fall into one of three levels: secondary, primary or transmission; Primary Level Customers - This rate is applicable to electric service required by any customer who receives service at 12,500 volts (nominal) to 69,000 volts and whose demand for power does not meet or exceed 3,000 kilowatts at any interval during the most recent June through September billing months as determined by the City of Austin.; Secondary Level Customers - This rate is applicable to electric service required by residential customers in single-family dwellings, mobile homes, townhouses, or individually metered apartment units. It is also applicable to any business that does not receive power at a primary or transmission level. Currently, some 30,000 businesses receive the secondary Fuel Charge rate; Transmission Level Customers - This rate is applicable to electric service required by any customer who receives service at 69,000 volts (nominal) or higher. This rate shall be applied for a minimum of one year.; Primary and transmission voltage level customers (about 90 industrial customers) essentially receive power directly from a substation. This results in reduced line losses between the point of generation and delivery to the customer. These customers also install and maintain their own equipment at their site needed to step down the voltage before the power enters their facility. As a result, primary and transmission customers pay a slightly lower Fuel Charge.","08/20/2015 02:47:04 PM +0000","182","Power Supply Adjustment/Fuel Charge","","Shannon Wisner","Utility","table","Annually","Austin Energy","false"

Please see the dark red “About” tab for a thumbnail of how the map is ideally viewed and two attachments. One attachment is a description of the metadata and the other attachment provides instructions for how to view the data properly; The Strategic Investment Areas map shows the geographic location of unfunded or long-term infrastructure needs identified in the FY 2016-17 LRCSP and the degree to which those future investments could enable recommendations in multiple City of Austin initiatives, as identified in the LRCSP Strategic Areas map (see the CPO LRCSP Strategic Areas dataset on the Open Data Portal). The degree of overlap with multiple City initiatives is indicated by darker shades. The goal of the analysis is to identify strategic areas for collaboration and coordination of capital investment related to implementing Imagine Austin. The data is organized around Imagine Austin Priority Program topic areas: Compact and Connected, Nature and City, Creativity and Economy, Healthy and Affordable. The purpose of the LRCSP Strategic Investment Areas Overlay Analysis is to support the identification of: (a) Strategic investment in infrastructure that implements Imagine Austin, (b) Potential cost savings and other efficiencies and (c) Improved outcomes for our capital investments. NOTE: the areas are updated periodically to respond to changes in both infrastructure needs and City plans and policies, as reflected in City Council-approved initiatives; *The Long-Range CIP Strategic Plan is produced annually, and the Planning Commission uses the plan to make its annual recommendation to the City Manager about projects necessary or desirable to implement the comprehensive plan, per its role in the City Charter.

There is considerable variability in the cost of repairing each pole, as the amount of damage varies per incident. This is the reason the costs for repairs can vary significantly from year to year.; Austin Energy bears the costs until they are offset by the amounts collected from the drivers and their insurance companies. In cases where a responsible party cannot be identified (leaving the scene of the incident), or in cases where it cannot be verified that they are at fault, Austin Energy must pay for the repairs. Austin Energy works with the Austin Police Department to identify drivers who have fled the scene of an accident.","05/12/2016 06:27:26 PM +0000","68","Graph of Streetlight and Power Poles Hit by Year","","Shannon Wisner","Utility","chart","Annually","Austin Energy","true"

A plan detailing the trimming needed for each tree on a property is discussed and provided to the property owner for their acknowledgment and signature. When property owners refuse to meet or cooperate with scheduling, they receive a refusal letter which indicates when trimming will occur.

One major strategy to achieve this goal was to implement a telework pilot.  ARR developed a telework policy and provided training to all participating employees and their managers.  The telework pilot ran from February 8, 2016, to May 6, 2016.  During this time, measures were taken regarding employees' schedules and commute habits as well as miles driven and estimated MPG of their cars in order to calculate emissions.  Surveys were also taken to gauge employee satisfaction and productivity associated with teleworking.  After reviewing the data and results from the pilot, ARR Director Bob Gedert approved the telework pilot to make it an official departmental program in July, 2016.","08/29/2016 07:31:12 PM +0000","18","Austin Resource Recovery Telework Pilot","","erin.benoit@austintexas.gov","","table","As Needed","Austin Resource Recovery","false"

During fiscal year 2012, about 15% of the power delivered from Austin Energy to its customers came from renewable resources. Purchase power agreements for wind, solar and biomass power will bring our renewable portfolio to 23% by the end of 2013; In June 2013 the Austin City Council approved three new wind contracts totaling 570 megawatts which will put the utility four years ahead of schedule for achieving its 35% renewable energy resources goal by 2020. Those new wind projects will come online between 2014 and 2016; Austin Energy's first utility-scale solar facility known as the Webberville Solar Project began producing electricity in December 2011. The utility is purchasing all of the electricity produced from the 30-megawatt facility over the next 25 years.

Each of the homes reduces its energy use by an average of about 1,200 kilowatt-hours annually due to these improvements. The program provides up to $1,500 in home improvements including installation of attic insulation, sealing and repair of ducts, solar screen installations, weather stripping around entry doors, and minor home repairs necessary to improve the effectiveness of the efficiency improvements; In FY 2010, Austin Energy received a grant of nearly $5.9 million from American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds that allowed for the weatherization of 1,064 homes and apartments for low-income, elderly, and disabled customers within Austin Energy’s service area. Under this program, each dwelling received, on average, about $5,000 worth of improvements including new energy efficient appliances and air conditioning and heating equipment; Because Austin Energy's implementation of the program was so successful, the utility received additional funding on three separate occasions in the amounts of $2.1 million, $200,000 and $1 million, for total funds of $9.2 million. This allowed the utility to nearly double the number of units receiving this enhanced free weatherization.; Under the Federal Weatherization Program which ended April 30, 2012, Austin Energy weatherized  1,886 homes, 77% more than the original goal of 1,064 homes. The homes were occupied by 4,529 people of whom 645 were elderly, 572 had disabilities and 758 were children under the age of 5. On average, each of the homes will save about 1,200 kilowatt-hours annually in energy costs due to the improvements; *In FY 2010 127 of the 456 homes received weatherization through the use of ARRA funds.; *In FY 2011 all homes received weatherization through the use of ARRA funds.; *In FY 2012, the 715 homes used both ARRA funds and AE funds; *Numbers are lower than expected in FY 2013 due to the late start of the program efforts.","09/06/2016 04:43:36 PM +0000","24","Weatherization Assistance Program","","Elaine Lee","Utility","table","Annually","Austin Energy","false"

Austin Energy set a goal that 35% of energy delivered to customers will come from renewable resources by 2020. In January 2013, two new wind contracts went online adding an additional 293.9 megawatts of wind power.  Additionally, Austin Energy is purchasing energy produced from the 30 megawatt Webberville Solar Project and a 100 megawatt biomass plant which went online in June 2012. Purchase power agreements for wind, solar and biomass power will bring our renewable portfolio to 23% by the end of 2013. In June 2013 the Austin City Council approved three new wind contracts totaling 570 megawatts which will put the utility four years ahead of schedule for meeting its 35% renewable energy resources goal by 2020.; Specific information related to purchase power agreements, such as pricing information, is confidential and excepted from disclosure under the Texas Public Information Act.","08/02/2016 03:42:09 PM +0000","11","Purchase Power Agreements","","Elaine Lee","Utility","table","As Needed","Austin Energy","false"
